    "Introduction: Comparing Grades of Sophomores and Juniors\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a big university where students study hard. We're curious to find out if there's a real difference in the average grades of sophomores (second-year students) and juniors (third-year students). Are juniors really doing better? To solve this puzzle, we collected information from 17 sophomores and 13 juniors about their grades. We're going to use some special math to figure out if the differences we see in grades are big enough to mean something important, or if they could just be random chance. Let's find out if there's enough proof to say that sophomores and juniors have different grades."
